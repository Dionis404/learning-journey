#Dice Roll
#Suppose we have two dice. üé≤ üé≤
#Create a game where one guesses the total value after rolling a pair of dice once.
# Each die has the integer values 1 to 6. Since there's two dice, the range of possible values is between 2 and 12 (inclusive).
# Use the random module to ‚Äúroll‚Äù the dice and store the random values of each die variable in a new total variable.
# Until the correct value is guessed, use a while loop to keep prompting the user for a number.
# Use while loops along with methods from the random module to solve this challenge.

dice1 = random.randint(1, 6)
dice2 = random.randint(1, 6)

total = dice1 + dice2 

x = int(input('–£–≥–∞–¥–∞–π —á–∏—Å–ª–æ –Ω–∞ –∫—É–±–∏–∫–∏–∞—Ö? ') )
