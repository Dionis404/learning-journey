#Ring in the New Year! A New Year's Eve party doesn't feel complete without a countdown from 10 to 1.
#Use a for loop and the range() function for a countdown.
#The output should look like:
#Counting down from 10 to 1 on each line and then a Happy New Year message at the end.
#Note: Feel free to end your message with any emoji you want!

for n in range(10, -1, -1):
  if n == 0: 
    print('Happy New Year ') 
  else:  
    print(n)
