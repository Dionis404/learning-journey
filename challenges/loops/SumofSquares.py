#A number is "squared" when it is either multiplied by itself or taken to the second power (e.g., 4² = 4 x 4 = 16).
# First, ask the user for an integer with int(input()) and store it in a number variable. Then, define a total variable with an initial value of 0.
# Note: You can pass a string prompt to int(input()).
# Next, use a for loop and range() function to calculate the total of the squares of all integers from 1 to that number.
# Last, print the output as an integer value.
# For example, if number is 5, the total should be 55 because:


number = int(input('Введите целое число: '))
total = 0 
for i in range(1, number+1):
    square = i ** 2 
    total = total + square

print(total)


#done
